Introduction to Web Development
I am looking to refresh my skills from web development in the 1990s

What have I learnt?

w3schools.com 
codewars to test

GA Dash - general assembly dash free course
FreeCodeCamp is recommended by Luke
CodeAcademy

How did I use this in practice?
I intend to use this to help with building a front end dashboard capability that
we have been looking to do but the engineers have not been able to complete as it isnt their skillset

 I didnt find the class very hard today but being tired from a long day i didnt actually have to bite my tongue a few times :)
